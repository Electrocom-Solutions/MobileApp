Redesign Home / Dashboard 

Goal: Redesign the Home (Dashboard) into a professional, modern, black-theme UX that gives a quick, useful overview and clear shortcuts. Keep the app’s default dark/black theme. Make the bottom persistent navigation show icons only (no labels). Deliver Flutter widgets/screens (production-ready), assets, and make sure whole application is working there shouln't be any errors.

Context to reuse (do not change):
	App default theme: Black theme / dark. (All UIs should have excellent contrast & legible typography on dark backgrounds.) 
	Primary navigation (persistent bottom): Home, Attendance, Tasks, Notifications, Profile. Only icons — no titles.
	Dashboard purpose: quick overview and shortcuts (attendance, tasks, quick actions, recent submissions).


High-level style & design rules
	Visual language
		Minimal, modern, professional. Use plenty of negative space and subtle elevation (soft shadows or glows) for cards.
		Rounded corners (12–18 px) on cards and buttons.
		Typography: Use a geometric sans (e.g., Google’s Poppins / Inter). Headline weight medium/semibold, body regular.
		Accent color: one primary accent (choose a vivid teal or electric blue — e.g., hex #00BFA6 or #2196F3) for CTA and status badges on top of black/dark gray surfaces.
		Background: pure black #000000 or dark gray #0B0B0D. Card surfaces: slightly lighter #0F1113 with 6–10% white overlay for elevation.

	Spacing & layout
		Use a 4/8/16 spacing scale.
		Top safe area → Greeting row → Cards grid/stack → Quick Actions row → Recent / Feed.
		Keep touch targets >= 44 px.

	Color & accessibility
		Minimum contrast ratio: 4.5:1 for body text, 3:1 for disabled text.
		Use subtle translucency for overlays and blur for map/photo previews.

	Micro-interactions
		Smooth card lifts on tap (scale 0.98 → 1.0).
		Punch success: Lottie checkmark animation + haptic.
		Loading states: skeleton cards (shimmer) not spinners.


Dashboard layout (structure + spec)
	Top bar (compact)
		Left: small avatar (circle) + greeting line: “Good afternoon, Vaibhav” (if name available).
		Right: small city chip + date (e.g., Tue, 04 Nov) and notification bell (with subtle badge).
		Microcopy: one line below greeting — “Today • 3 tasks • Punched in at 09:02” (compose dynamically).

	Hero card (wide) — Attendance Snapshot
		Prominent card spanning width: large circular status (Punched / Not punched), timestamp, small map thumbnail or selfie avatar.
		Primary CTA: Punch In / Punch Out as a large pill button — make this the most visually prominent element.
		Secondary CTA: quick “Mark Break” or “Request Correction” small text link.

	Stats row (3 compact cards)
		Small horizontally scrollable or fixed 3 cards: Ongoing tasks, Pending approvals, Today’s logged hours.
		Each card: icon, numeric highlight, one-line label. Use accent color for numbers.

	Quick Actions (icon grid / segmented)
		4 action buttons in a 2x2 grid or horizontal chips: Create Task, Start Shift, Scan Document, Report Issue.
		Use circular icon buttons with subtle backdrop and brief label underneath (small). Add ripple + short elevation.

	Recent items / Activity feed
		Vertical list showing the 3–5 most recent items: submitted tasks awaiting review, last punches, announcements.
		Each row: left small avatar/icon, title, microcopy (who, when), right small action (chevron / accept button).

	Optional: Project status carousel
		Horizontal cards showing top 3 projects (name, progress bar, deadline). Tap to open project.

	Floating Action Button
		A single FAB anchored bottom-right for the primary flow (Punch In / Create Task — choose context aware). If FAB is used for Punch, label tooltip on long press. Make FAB circular, slightly elevated with accent color and subtle glow.

	Empty state
		Friendly illustration with short copy and CTA (e.g., “No recent updates — create your first task”). Use Lottie or simple vector.
