Theme & Look
Use dark mode as the default.
Background: very dark gray or black (#0b0d11 or similar).
Cards: slightly lighter background (#111318 or similar).
Accent color: vibrant blue (#007bff or similar to the blue in the screenshot).
Text: use light gray or white (#e0e0e0 for main text, #9ca3af for secondary).
Keep everything rounded, minimal, and consistent.
Use soft shadows or glows for depth.
Home / Dashboard Screen
The Home screen should be the main page employees see after login.
 It should feel welcoming and informative, but not crowded.
Sections:
Top Section – Greeting & Date
A small row showing:
“Good Morning, Vaibhav 👋” (dynamic based on time)
Today’s date (like “Tuesday, 4 November”)
Below that, a summary line such as:
“You are not punched in yet” OR “Punched in at 9:04 AM”


Hero Card – Punch In / Punch Out
A large, centered card at the top of the dashboard.
Shows current attendance status:
If not punched in → show “Punch In” button
If already punched in → show “Punched In” with time and “Punch Out” button
Use the bright blue accent color for the active button.


When user clicks “Punch In”:
Open a popup window or modal overlaying the screen.
Inside this popup:
Show a large circle camera view (live camera preview).
User must take a selfie.
After taking the selfie:
Automatically capture location (GPS) and current time.
Show a confirmation screen with:
Selfie preview (small thumbnail)
Captured location (address or map)
Timestamp
Button: Confirm & Mark Attendance
Only after the user confirms, mark them as Present.
Show a small success animation or message like:
 “Attendance marked successfully ✅”



Important:
 Remove any floating Punch button that hovers at the bottom —
 the one inside the hero card is enough.


Info Tiles Row (3 Cards)
Below the hero card, show three small info cards in one row:
Pending Tasks
Total Working Days
Days Present
Each card should:
Use the same card style (dark background with blue accent number)
Have a small icon and short label.


Quick Action Section
Keep only one card here: “Create New Task”.
Remove the other 3 actions.
This card should take the full width of the row,
 like a large, attractive blue button card.
Add a plus icon (+) and text like:
 “Create a New Task”
 Small subtext: “Quickly assign or start a task”


Recent Activity Section
Show a simple vertical list of latest actions:
“You punched in at 9:04 AM”
“You completed Task #125”
“New task assigned by Admin”
Each list item should have:
Small circular icon
Title
Subtext (time, e.g. “5 hours ago”)
Keep it minimal and clean.
