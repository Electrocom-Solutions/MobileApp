# ⚠️ CRITICAL INFORMATION - PLEASE READ

## This is a Flutter Mobile App Project

### Why There Are No Workflows Configured

**Flutter mobile applications CANNOT run in the Replit web environment.**

This project is designed to be:
1. **Downloaded** from Replit to your local machine
2. **Run locally** using Flutter SDK with Android/iOS emulators or physical devices

### Why Workflows Can't Be Configured in Replit

Replit workflows are designed for:
- Web applications (React, Node.js, Python Flask, etc.)
- Backend APIs
- Command-line tools
- Applications that run in a browser or terminal

Flutter mobile apps require:
- ✗ Flutter SDK (not available in Replit)
- ✗ Android emulators or iOS simulators (not available in Replit)
- ✗ Physical Android/iOS devices (cannot connect to Replit)
- ✗ Platform-specific build tools (Android Studio, Xcode)

### What You Need to Do

1. **Download all project files** from this Replit
2. **Install Flutter SDK** on your local machine (Windows/Mac/Linux)
3. **Open terminal** in the project directory
4. **Run** `flutter pub get` to install dependencies
5. **Run** `flutter run` to launch the app on your device/emulator

### Complete Setup Instructions

See **README.md** for detailed step-by-step instructions on:
- Installing Flutter SDK
- Setting up Android Studio or Xcode
- Running the app on emulators or physical devices
- Troubleshooting common issues

---

**This is NOT a limitation of the code - it's a fundamental difference between mobile apps and web apps.**

Flutter mobile apps are compiled to native Android (APK/AAB) and iOS (IPA) applications that run on mobile devices, not in web browsers.
